# Each edge or canary is assigned a unique ID. This ID is used to reference
# and make requests to the individual edge canary by connecting to the test
# web server on a specific host address.
#
# The final octet of the server host address is used as the requested edge ID.
#
# Examples:
# 127.0.0.3     =  Edge 3
# 127.1.10.5    =  Edge 5
# 127.0.0.101   =  Canary 1
#
# The web server will give a response with delay, timeout or close the
# connection depending on the edge configuration.
